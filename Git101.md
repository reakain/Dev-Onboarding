## Installing Git
These are steps on how to install git for each operating system.

### On Windows
Download Git for Windows from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Once downloaded, run the installer with administrator privileges and process through the installer as below.

*Note:* Feel free to choose your preferred option for the text editor. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a user friendly and popular option if you're not sure what to pick.

Once the installer has finished, we recommend setting the Git Bash to start up in your home directory. This is accomplished by navigating to the shortcut properties, and appending  ```--cd-to-home``` after the last quotation mark in the Target field.

### On Linux
Open up the terminal and run the command: ```sudo apt get install git``` enter the sudo password if required, and when asked whether you want to install git, enter ```y``` for yes.

### On Mac
TBA

## Configuration
This section has various configuration options.

### Git Config User Info
First step is setting up your name and username in git. So open Git Bash (or terminal on linux or mac), which acts nominally the same as a linux terminal, and then enter the two lines below, replacing the NAME and EMAIL with your information.

```
    git config --global user.name NAME
    git config --global user.email EMAIL
```

### SSH Key Linking

### Organizing Your Repositories
Once that's complete, you'll want a directory to store all your repositories in. This can be created from the command line using the ```mkdir``` command.

You can see all the files and folders in the current directory with the ```ls``` command. Then, you'll want to go into the newly made folder using the ```cd``` command.

## Terminology

 - *Repository:* A git project. Each repository, or repo, is a folder that contains its own version history. This repo can be a single piece of code, a larger multi-system project, or really anything you want to put in a folder.
 - *Clone:* A clone is a local copy of a repository. To get a local copy of a remote repo, you complete a clone command.
 - *Fork:* A fork is how you make your own centralized, separate copy of someone else's repo for you to make changes to.
 - *Commit:* A commit is a snapshot of changes to the code. Each commit has a message and a unique id string, so you can see all commits in the repo's history.
 - *Branch:* Repositories have branches, such as main, or borked-fix-13 that allow developers to branch off the history of the code to work on individual issues or improvements, without changing whatever the core or release level code base is. These issues can then be *merged* back into the code at a later point.
 - *Push:* When you push, you are telling the system to take your local changes to the repo (or commits) to the remote origin where the data is housed/backed up. This is normally either [github](https://github.com) or [gitlab](https://gitlab.com).
 - *Pull:* When you pull, you are telling the system to take changes that have been applied to the remote system, and copy them down into your local repository. If you have any local changes then they could be lost, or the system might ask you to complete a merge of your history with the remote history, which gets... More complicated.
 - *Pull request:* A pull request is how you ask someone else to bring in changes from your forked repo to the original or higher level copy of the project.
